## 2. Binding ownership after IM-18

- Frozen IM-17 remains the economic construction authority from Player commit through material demand, delivery-driven construction progress and exactly-once completion.
- Existing Building lifecycle remains separate from Building Construction state and from operational admission.
- IM-18A consumes existing construction completion and Building lifecycle; it does not create a second Building or completion authority.
- Existing Person workforce profiles and Workforce assignment-state contracts remain authoritative. IM-18B/C only define requirement, eligibility and deterministic assignment integration.
- Existing production BuildingStock recipe remains authoritative. IM-18D binds assigned operational workforce to that existing recipe for the same Building.
- Existing BuildingStock remains production input/output inventory authority. IM-18E evaluates availability; IM-18F mutates stock through existing mutation contracts.
- IM-18F protects production settlement from duplicate application by settlement ID.
- IM-18G is Player-facing projection only and owns no Building, workforce, recipe, production, stock or settlement truth.
- Existing Runtime, Resource, Transport, Scheduler, SaveGame, Selection and Camera boundaries remain authoritative.
- IM-15 Inspector remains observer/guidance except its already frozen diagnostic action allowlist.

## 3. IM-18 – Operational Building / Workforce / Production Integration

**Status:** COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER

**Definition baseline:** frozen IM-17 @ `53de400c2ffe57addf832b599b906b3d5b473385`.

**Frozen Whole-Block head:** `2d068aa357ec5d1fe8f53eb867037021d04caddf`.

**Frozen marker:** `frozen/im-18-operational-building-workforce-production-integration`.

### Whole-Block flow

`frozen IM-17 completed Building → operational admission → workforce requirement/eligibility → deterministic workforce assignment → existing production recipe integration → input readiness evaluation → deterministic BuildingStock settlement → read-only Player operational-state projection`.

The complete flow is covered by frozen IM-18A through IM-18G without introducing a second Building, Person, Workforce, Recipe, Production or BuildingStock authority.

### IM-18A – Operational Building Admission Contract

Requires construction completion for the same stable Building and Building lifecycle `EXISTS` before the Building can enter the operational chain.

### IM-18B – Workforce Requirement / Eligibility Contract

Defines worker count, specialization and required capabilities for an operational Building; eligibility consumes only existing workforce profiles and assignment state.

### IM-18C – Deterministic Workforce Assignment Integration

Assigns the deterministic stable-ID-first subset of eligible free persons through existing Workforce assignment state. Insufficient eligible workforce is rejected.

### IM-18D – Production Requirement / Recipe Integration

Requires successfully assigned workforce and reuses the existing production BuildingStock recipe for the same Building.

### IM-18E – Operational Production Execution

Evaluates actual BuildingStock input availability and yields `READY` or `BLOCKED_INPUT`. Production cannot execute with insufficient input.

### IM-18F – Input Consumption / Output Settlement

On successful execution, consumes real recipe inputs and adds real outputs through existing BuildingStock mutation authority. Duplicate settlement IDs are rejected.

### IM-18G – Player Operational State Projection

Projects authoritative operational state only, including missing workforce, waiting for inputs, production readiness and settled production. UI remains read-only.

## 4. IM-19 – Population / Housing / Gold Economy Integration

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Definition baseline:** frozen IM-18 @ `2d068aa357ec5d1fe8f53eb867037021d04caddf`.

**Whole-Block branch:** `feature/im-19-population-housing-gold-economy-integration`.

### IM-19A – Residential Building Admission Contract

**Status:** COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER

**Frozen head:** `b528081409407ad531a450e5deb832ee7a0031e7`  
**Marker:** `frozen/im-19a-residential-building-admission-contract`

Consumes frozen IM-18A operational admission, existing Building identity and the existing `building-housing` capability. Admission requires matching stable `buildingId` and positive existing housing capacity. No occupancy, resident assignment, population or Gold mutation is introduced.

Implementation head `c46ef9a7739fee8a82397f4c6b605c1a7a94dc94` passed its first regression/device gate. Final exact-head CI and Pages then succeeded on `b528081409407ad531a450e5deb832ee7a0031e7`; the frozen IM-19A marker was created and verified identical.

### IM-19B – Housing Capacity / Occupancy Integration

**Status:** COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER

**Frozen head:** `3ba5a17761ac7f8bce3f01a49cbaef515728c355`  
**Marker:** `frozen/im-19b-housing-capacity-occupancy-integration`

Connects an admitted residential Building to the existing `HousingCapacityOccupancy` authority and derives existing occupancy, available slots and `AVAILABLE/FULL` state. Existing `resident-home-assignment` contracts are input only; IM-19B creates no assignment and no Population or Gold truth.

Final evidence: CI `34682616074` SUCCESS and Pages `34682615729` SUCCESS on exact frozen head `3ba5a17761ac7f8bce3f01a49cbaef515728c355`. Device evidence was **iPhone/Safari only**. Earlier steering text that also mentioned iPad evidence was incorrect and is corrected here. The narrow iPhone layout/overlap remains NON-BLOCKING for IM-19B because no CSS/layout file changed in the IM-19B diff.

### IM-19C – Resident → Housing Assignment Integration

**Status:** COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER

**Frozen head:** `0874cbb7102e738e3a4b32cbf2d40c4c0ebcb408`  
**Marker:** `frozen/im-19c-resident-housing-assignment-integration`

**Definition baseline:** frozen IM-19B @ `3ba5a17761ac7f8bce3f01a49cbaef515728c355`.

Consumes existing stable `person-resident-identity` contracts and frozen-IM-19B Housing integration states. Candidate persons and Housing are ordered deterministically by stable ID; persons that already have an active home are preserved and never reassigned. New home assignments are created only through the existing `HousingHomeCapacityIntegrationContract.assignHome(...)` authority and never exceed existing Housing capacity.

IM-19C creates no new Person/Resident, derives no Population, changes no Workforce state and touches no Gold state.

Final evidence: real **iPhone/Safari** device PASS plus CI `34686333542` SUCCESS and Pages `34686333201` SUCCESS on exact frozen head `0874cbb7102e738e3a4b32cbf2d40c4c0ebcb408`. No iPad evidence is claimed for IM-19C.

### IM-19D – Authoritative Population Projection

**Status:** COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER

**Frozen head:** `0847d27b60f13a99cb76d220b56b58107e832950`  
**Marker:** `frozen/im-19d-authoritative-population-projection`

**Definition baseline:** frozen IM-19C @ `0874cbb7102e738e3a4b32cbf2d40c4c0ebcb408`.

Projects Population read-only from frozen-IM-19C active Resident→Home assignments plus existing `person-resident-identity` contracts. Only existing Residents with an authoritative active home in frozen-IM-19B Housing are counted. The projected count must equal authoritative Housing occupancy; inconsistent identity/assignment/occupancy truth is rejected instead of repaired.

The projection includes immutable trace entries `personId → homeBuildingId → COUNTED` as a future read-only diagnostics source for the Inspector. **No Inspector UI/visualization is implemented in IM-19D.** No Person creation, Housing mutation, Home assignment mutation, Workforce mutation or Gold mutation is added.

Freeze-gate correction: the first IM-19D device evidence showed the correct build identity but the visible Population still came from the older CR-30B `housingPopulation.population` runtime path. This was a BLOCKER. The current branch now creates the real frozen-IM-19A→B→C residential assignment chain in the baseline composition, exposes `CleanRuntime.populationProjection`, and makes HUD + read-only Inspector consume that IM-19D projection. Existing Gold continues to use its prior owner/path; IM-19E is not pre-implemented. The corrected deployment has now passed the fresh real **iPhone/Safari TESTBUILD 2** re-test. The screenshots visibly confirm `IM-19D-AUTHORITATIVE-POPULATION-PROJECTION-TESTBUILD-2`, `READY`, Population `3` in HUD and Inspector, and `IM-19D · TESTBUILD 2` on the lower surface. CI `34687205200` and Pages `34687204928` both succeeded on exact implementation head `149f37fbdc2aa3d1f05301a38ee3eb9452abec40`. A final documentation-only exact-head CI + Pages verification is required before the frozen IM-19D marker is created.

### IM-19E – Gold Economy Admission / Flow Integration

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED / NOT FROZEN

**Definition baseline:** frozen IM-19D @ `0847d27b60f13a99cb76d220b56b58107e832950`.

Admits only `POPULATION_INCOME` from frozen-IM-19D authoritative Population into the existing non-physical `GoldEconomyOwner` derivation path. The derived amount is read-only at this stage: admission must leave the existing Gold balance unchanged.

No `applyIncome`, Gold settlement, settlement ID or balance-after state is part of IM-19E. Those remain IM-19F scope. Taxes, trade, wages and physical/BuildingStock Gold remain excluded.

### Whole-Block question

`How are real completed/operational Buildings connected to the existing Housing, Population and non-physical Gold model so that residents, available population and Gold economy become gameplay-effective without duplicating Building, Person, Workforce, Housing, Population, Production or Gold authority?`

### Defined sequence

1. **IM-19A – Residential Building Admission Contract**  
   Admit only suitable existing real Buildings to the existing Housing system. No occupancy assignment, population mutation or Gold flow.

2. **IM-19B – Housing Capacity / Occupancy Integration**  
   Connect admitted residential Buildings to existing Housing capacity/occupancy authority.

3. **IM-19C – Resident → Housing Assignment Integration**  
   Deterministically connect existing stable Resident/Person identities to available Housing while keeping Housing and Workforce independent.

4. **IM-19D – Authoritative Population Projection**  
   Derive population from authoritative resident/housing state rather than maintaining a second mutable Player population total.

5. **IM-19E – Gold Economy Admission / Flow Integration**  
   Connect the existing non-physical Gold model to explicitly admitted real economic events. Gold remains non-physical and is not BuildingStock.

6. **IM-19F – Operational Economy → Gold Settlement**  
   Apply defined economic events to authoritative Gold state without expanding into taxes, wages or trade.

7. **IM-19G – Player Population / Housing / Gold Projection**  
   Read-only Player projection of actual population, housing capacity/occupancy and Gold state.

### Future Inspector – Whole Clean-Runtime Rebuild Chain (NON-SCOPE)

Later Inspector visualization should cover the **entire CR/IM Clean-Runtime rebuild graph** with sequential steps, branches, ownership boundaries and frozen gates. Individual gameplay traces such as the IM-19D Resident→Home count trace are only subordinate evidence and are not the intended scope of the overall chain view. No Inspector graph UI is implemented in IM-19E.

## 5. IM-19 exclusions

IM-19 does not include taxes, marketplace/trade, wages, needs/happiness, births, deaths, aging, migration, demolition, upgrades, a new production subsystem, new routing/transport authority, SaveGame rearchitecture, Inspector editor authority or legacy `main` gameplay reuse.

## 6. Current gate

**IM-18 = COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER.**

**IM-19 = IN PROGRESS.**

**IM-19A = COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER.**

**IM-19B = COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER.**

**IM-19C = COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER.**

**IM-19D = COMPLETE / FROZEN / PASS / 0 BLOCKER.**

**IM-19E = IMPLEMENTED / NOT FROZEN.**

The next permissible step is exclusively IM-19E Completion / Regression / Device / Freeze Gate. IM-19F remains blocked until IM-19E is frozen.
